		<img src="images/intro-pic.jpg" alt="A beautiful living room." title="Welcome to Exceptional Realty Group" />
		<!-- foldername/ = go inside the folder
		vs filename = use a file in the same/current directory
		../ brings you up a level, relative to the file you're currently on. so you wouldn't need ot say images/ if the picture was just in the current directory (exceptional realty) w all the other pages
		../ = leave the current folder and go up to the parent folder/directory
		finally, the alt text will be read to visually impaired people, and will be available for search engines
		lastly, an attribute to make a caption appear when user hovers over image, you can do title="etc"  peep
